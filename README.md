# Quasi-elastic-DM

## The model

This is the model of dark photons $A$ coupled to a dark matter candidate $\chi$. Depending on the variation, the $A\chi$ coupling may be elastic, $A\chi \chi$, or inelastic $A\chi \chi'$, where $\chi'$ is a slightly heavier than $\chi$. The non-zero (yet tiny) mass splitting allows to escape the direct detection constraints. Such models are also known as the BC2 model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09966).

The model's parameters are $`m_{A},m_{\chi}, \alpha_{D}, \epsilon`$, where $m$ are masses, $\alpha_{D} = g_{D}^{2}/4\pi$ is the coupling of the dark photons to the dark matter, and $\epsilon$ controls dark photon coupling to the SM. Typically, $\alpha_{D}$ and $m_{\chi}/m_{V}$ are fixed; their values are chosen in a way such that dark photon predominantly decays invisibly - into $\chi\chi'$ psirs. The commonly considered choice is $\alpha_{D} = 0.1$ (subject to a simple rescale) and $m_{\chi} = m_{A}/3$.

The sensitivity is given in terms of the parameters $m_{\chi}$ and $Y = \alpha_{D}\epsilon^{2}(m_{\chi}/m_{A})^{4}$.
